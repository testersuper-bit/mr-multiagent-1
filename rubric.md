Agent Workflow Diagram
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Illustrate the architecture of the multi-agent system, including agent responsibilities and orchestration.

The workflow diagram includes all of the agents in the multi-agent system (maximum of five agents as per project constraints).
Each agent has explicitly defined responsibilities that do not overlap with other systems.
The orchestration logic and data flow between agents is clear.
Illustrate the interactions between agents and their tools, specifying the purpose of each tool.

The workflow diagram depicts tools associated with specific agents.
For each tool depicted, its purpose and the specific helper function(s) from the starter code it intends to use is specified in the diagram.
The diagram shows interactions (e.g., data input/output) between agents and their respective tools.
Multi-Agent System Implementation
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Implement the multi-agent system with distinct orchestrator and worker agent roles as per their diagram.

The implemented multi-agent system architecture (agents, their primary roles) matches the submitted agent workflow diagram.
The system includes an orchestrator agent that manages task delegation to other agents.
The system implements distinct worker agents (or clearly separated functionalities within agents) for different tasks such as:
 Inventory management (e.g., checking stock, assessing reorder needs)
Quoting (e.g., generating prices, considering discounts)
Sales finalization (e.g., processing orders, updating database).
The student selects and utilizes one of the recommended agent orchestration frameworks (smolagents, pydantic-ai, or npcsh) for the implementation.
Implement tools for agents using the provided helper functions, ensuring all required functions are utilized.

Tools for different agents are defined in the code according to the conventions of the selected agent orchestration framework.
All of the following helper functions from the starter code are used in at least one tool definition within the implemented system: create_transaction, get_all_inventory, get_stock_level, get_supplier_delivery_date, get_cash_balance, generate_financial_report, search_quote_history.
Evaluation and Reflection
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Evaluate the multi-agent system using the provided dataset and document the results.

The multi-agent system is evaluated using the full set of requests provided in quote_requests_sample.csv and the results of the evaluation are submitted in test_results.csv.
The test_results.csv file (or equivalent documented output) demonstrates that:
At least three requests result in a change to the cash balance.
At least three quote requests are successfully fulfilled.
Not all requests from quote_requests_sample.csv are fulfilled, with reasons provided or implied for unfulfilled requests (e.g., insufficient stock).
Reflect on the architecture, implementation, and performance evaluation of the multi-agent system.

The reflection report:

contains an explanation of the agent workflow diagram, detailing the roles of the agents and the decision-making process that led to the chosen architecture. The student may refer to their diagram file, but the explanation must be in this text report.
discusses the evaluation results from test_results.csv, identifying specific strengths of the implemented system. The student may refer to their test_results.csv file, but the discussion must be in this text report.
includes at least two distinct suggestions for further improvements to the system, based on the identified areas of improvement or new potential features.
Industry Best Practices
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Provide transparent and explainable outputs for customer-facing interactions.

Outputs generated by the system (e.g., quotes, responses to inquiries) for the "customer" contain all the information directly relevant to the customer's request.
Outputs provided to the "customer" include a rationale or justification for key decisions or outcomes, where appropriate (e.g., why a quote is priced a certain way if discounts are applied, why an order cannot be fulfilled).
Customer-facing outputs do not reveal sensitive internal company information (e.g., exact profit margins, internal system error messages) or any personally identifiable information (PII) beyond what's essential for the transaction.
Write code that is readable, well-commented, and modular.

Variable and function names in the Python code are descriptive and consistently follow a discernible naming convention (e.g., snake_case for functions and variables, PascalCase for classes, if applicable).
The code consists of comments and docstrings at appropriate places.
Logic within the code has been broken down sufficiently into individual modules.
